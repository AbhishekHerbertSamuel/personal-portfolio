            <p>
                I am an aspiring software engineer in the final year of my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in the Internet of Things at Shiv Nadar University, Chennai. My passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to gain proficiency in multiple programming languages and frameworks, including Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C, Flask, and React. I have containerized and deployed applications using Docker, Git and Render.

Through my academic coursework, projects, and internships, I have acquired hands-on experience across the entire Software Development Lifecycle, exploring domains such as Generative AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, IoT, Data Analytics, and Full-stack Development. 
As a team player and active contributor, I thrive in collaborative settings and continuously seek to learn and grow. I have participated in national-level hackathons and was a finalist at VIT Chennai’s HACKOVERFLOW. 

I have multiple certifications from prestigious organizations and universities, including Google, Stanford, and IIT Madras. I was ranked in the top 5% in the course Data Science for Engineers, conducted by IIT Madras as a part of the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL).

Beyond my technical pursuits, I am deeply passionate about music. I am a western classical singer and pianist with advanced certifications from the Trinity College of Music, London, and the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. Additionally, I have excelled in oratory, earning two awards from the Governor of Tamil Nadu.

I co-founded the SNUC Business Club, where I have been actively involved in organizing events and raising funds for the past three years. As a Student Ambassador for my university, I enjoy engaging with prospective students and helping them navigate the admissions process.

Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to innovative software engineering projects and continue my journey of learning and growth.
